# Minority Stress Stimuli, from the project "Working for INclusion. The well-being of sexual minority people: Neurophysiological and Behavioral mechanisms (WIN-NB)"
These stimuli are part of a multidisciplinary ongoing project involving the University of Trento (P.I. Gianluca Esposito; 1 study) and La Sapienza University (P.I. Roberto Baiocco; 2 studies).
The audio were used in the fNIRS study by University of Trento, conducted by Jacopo Schenetti, Alessandro Carollo and Gianluca Esposito.
